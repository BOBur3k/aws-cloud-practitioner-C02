## Networking

### **What is a VPC in AWS, and why is it important?**
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It is important because it provides complete control over your network configuration, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

### **What is a subnet, and how is it used in a VPC?**
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. Subnets are used to partition the VPC’s network into smaller, more manageable segments. Each subnet resides in a specific Availability Zone, allowing you to distribute resources across different zones to ensure high availability.

### **What is an Internet Gateway, and what role does it play in a VPC?**
An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It acts as a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and provides a gateway for communication to and from the internet.

### **What is a NAT Gateway, and why would you use it in a VPC?**
A Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but it prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. It’s used to maintain the security of instances that don't need to accept inbound connections from the internet.

### **What is a Route Table, and how does it function in a VPC?**
A Route Table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your VPC is associated with a route table that controls the routing of traffic leaving the subnet.

### **What is a VPC Peering Connection, and what are its use cases?**
A VPC Peering Connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. Peering connections can be used within the same AWS account or between different AWS accounts and are typically used for inter-VPC communication.

### **What is a Security Group, and how does it enhance security in a VPC?**
A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. It enhances security by allowing you to specify the types of traffic that are allowed or denied to/from your instances.

### **What is a Network ACL (Access Control List), and how does it differ from a Security Group?**
A Network ACL is a stateless, optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. Unlike Security Groups, which are stateful, Network ACLs are stateless, meaning they require explicit rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

### **How do you use Network ACLs to enhance security within a VPC?**
Network ACLs are used to provide an additional layer of security by defining rules for traffic at the subnet level. They can be used to block specific IP addresses or ranges and to control the flow of traffic into and out of your subnets.

### **What is an Elastic IP Address, and how is it used in a VPC?**
An Elastic IP Address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It allows you to mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance within your VPC.

### **What is a Virtual Private Gateway, and how does it function in a VPC?**
A Virtual Private Gateway is the Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection. It allows you to establish a secure, encrypted connection between your VPC and your remote network.

### **What is Amazon Route 53, and what are its primary functions?**
Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Its primary functions include domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

### **What is the purpose of DNS in the context of Route 53?**
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses. In the context of Route 53, DNS is used to route end-user requests to the appropriate endpoints, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, or S3 buckets.

### **How does Route 53 provide high availability and reliability for DNS queries?**
Route 53 provides high availability and reliability by automatically routing DNS queries to the best possible endpoint based on factors like latency, health checks, and routing policies (e.g., failover, geolocation).

### **What is geolocation routing in Route 53, and what are its benefits?**
Geolocation routing in Route 53 allows you to route traffic based on the geographic location of the user making the request. This can improve performance and compliance by directing users to the nearest or most appropriate endpoint.

### **What is Amazon CloudFront, and what are its primary functions?**
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that distributes your content globally through a network of edge locations. Its primary functions include delivering web content, streaming media, and securing content delivery.

### **What are the benefits of using Amazon CloudFront?**
Benefits of using Amazon CloudFront include faster content delivery, reduced latency, enhanced security through integration with AWS Shield and WAF, and scalability to handle high traffic loads.

### **What is AWS Global Accelerator, and what is its purpose?**
AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of your applications by routing traffic through AWS global network infrastructure. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints.

### **What is the difference between Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator?**
Amazon CloudFront is primarily used for content delivery to end-users, while AWS Global Accelerator is designed to optimize the performance and availability of specific application endpoints across multiple AWS regions.

### **What is edge location in the context of Amazon CloudFront?**
An edge location is a data center that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users around the world.

### **What is AWS Direct Connect, and what are its primary benefits?**
AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that establishes a dedicated network connection between your premises and AWS. Primary benefits include reduced network costs, increased bandwidth throughput, and a more consistent network experience compared to internet-based connections.

### **What are common use cases for AWS Direct Connect?**
Common use cases for AWS Direct Connect include data migration, hybrid cloud setups, high-performance computing, and scenarios requiring consistent, low-latency connections to AWS resources.

### **What is AWS VPN, and how does it differ from AWS Direct Connect?**
AWS VPN (Virtual Private Network) provides a secure connection between your on-premises network or client device and AWS. Unlike AWS Direct Connect, which provides a dedicated physical connection, AWS VPN operates over the public internet.

### **What types of AWS VPN connections are available?**
AWS offers two types of VPN connections: Site-to-Site VPN, which connects your on-premises network to your AWS VPC, and Client VPN, which allows individual users to securely access your AWS resources.

### **What is a Transit Gateway, and how does it benefit network connectivity?**
A Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, simplifying network architecture. It benefits connectivity by enabling the communication of multiple VPCs, AWS accounts, and on-premises networks through a single gateway.
