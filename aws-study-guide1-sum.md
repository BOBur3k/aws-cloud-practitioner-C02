### 1. Cloud Computing Essentials

**What is it?** 
Renting computing resources over the internet instead of owning physical hardware.

**Main Models:**
- Public Cloud: Shared resources (like AWS)
- Private Cloud: Dedicated to one organization
- Hybrid Cloud: Mix of public and private

**Why use it?**
- Scale up or down easily
- Pay only for what you use
- Work from anywhere
- Built-in backups and redundancy

### 2. Amazon EC2: Virtual Servers in the Cloud

**Core Concept:** 
Rent virtual servers (instances) in AWS data centers.

**Instance Types:**
- General Purpose: Balanced resources
- Compute Optimized: For CPU-intensive tasks
- Memory Optimized: For large data processing
- Storage Optimized: For high disk I/O

**Buying Options:**
- On-Demand: Pay by the second
- Reserved: Commit for 1-3 years, get a discount
- Spot: Bid on spare capacity, cheaper but less reliable

**AMIs:** Pre-configured templates for your instances

### 3. AWS Global Infrastructure

**Regions:** 
Geographical areas with multiple data centers

**Availability Zones:** 
Isolated locations within a region for fault tolerance

**Edge Locations:** 
Content delivery points for faster access worldwide

### 4. Keeping Services Running Smoothly

**High Availability:** 
Keeping services accessible even if something fails

**Load Balancing:** 
Distributing traffic across multiple servers

**Auto Scaling:** 
Automatically adjusting the number of servers based on demand

### 5. Interacting with AWS

**Ways to Manage AWS:**
- Web Console: Point-and-click interface
- Command Line (CLI): Text commands
- SDKs: For programming languages
- APIs: For custom integrations

### 6. EC2 in More Detail

**Key Features:**
- Elasticity: Grow or shrink resources automatically
- Security Groups: Virtual firewalls for instances
- Network ACLs: Firewall for subnets

**Launching an Instance:**
1. Pick a template (AMI)
2. Choose instance type
3. Configure network and storage
4. Set up security
5. Start your instance

### Remember:

1. AWS offers a wide range of cloud services beyond just servers
2. You can deploy globally for better performance and reliability
3. Only pay for what you use
4. AWS handles infrastructure, you manage your data and applications
5. Combine different AWS services to build complex solutions
